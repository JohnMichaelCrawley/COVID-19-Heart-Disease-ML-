# COVID-19-Heart-Disease-ML-
Python project I did for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to create a Regression task based on COVID-19 with a CSV file to read the data into a DataFrame, standardize the data, plot some data statistics such as graphs and mean, variance, R2 etc. 
and Classification task for Heart Disease to perform the same tasks to standardise the data, plot some data statistics such as graphs and mean, variance, R2 etc and compare. 

# Notes
I ran out of time to finish this project for college and had to submit what is here but I do plan on completing the project fully very soon.
